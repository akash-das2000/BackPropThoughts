  "title": "Part 2: From Brownian Motion to Discrete Diffusion: The Mathematical Foundations of DDPM",
  "summary": "We trace the full mathematical backbone of denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). Starting from Brownian motion and quadratic variation, we derive the Fokker–Planck PDE, Anderson’s reverse-time SDE, and their discrete DDPM formulation. We then show how the ELBO training objective simplifies to noise prediction and illustrate the theory with a minimal 2D Gaussian mixture implementation. This post builds a rigorous bridge from stochastic calculus to practical diffusion algorithms.",
