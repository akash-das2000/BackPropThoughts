  "summary": "Explore advanced techniques in diffusion models: steer generation with classifier-free and model-guidance, scale to high-resolution synthesis via latent diffusion and KL factorization, establish non-asymptotic convergence rates using Wasserstein gradient flows and the JKO scheme, and reformulate reverse SDEs as stochastic control problems with applications to inverse tasks through Plug-and-Play priors and Regularized Score Distillation.",
