  "summary": "An in-depth mathematical journey through score-based diffusion: derive the analytic noising kernel, obtain unbiased score labels via Bayes’ rule, eliminate partition functions with Hyvärinen’s integration-by-parts, connect denoising auto-encoders through Vincent’s Taylor expansion, and implement everything in four lines of PyTorch with numerical hacks like the Hutchinson trace trick.",
